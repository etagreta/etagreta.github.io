# Greta Coraglia

I am a postdoc with [LUCI Lab](https://luci.unimi.it/) at the University of Milan, working on the [BRIO](https://sites.unimi.it/brio/) project. I am a member of the Scientific Committee of the [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io/) community.

I was previously a PhD student in the [Mathematics Department at the University of Genova](https://www2.dima.unige.it/), working under the supervision of [Pino Rosolini](https://www.dima.unige.it/~rosolini/) together with the rest of the [logic group](http://logic.dima.unige.it/) there.

I am interested in logic, category theory, and theoretical computer science. Currently, I am trying to use all of this for better AI practices and AI literacy.
